More difficulty:
	Turn bought Star Fields into Bowser Fields
	Boo costs more and steals less
	Items cost more, but more powerful
	Day/Nightcycle 
	Toad is a NPC wandering the map, having an own Dice each turn, but can only land on blue spaces (you have to get to toad, not
	viable if he passes a character)
	Bowser could join as very hard NPC (only 4-player?) and if he wins, something fucked up happens (like increased difficulty without
	the possibility to change it until he is defeated again); Triggers everytime a Duel if he lands on character space (steals 20 coins if you loose but 
	you can win a star if he looses)
	Chance Time includes Bowser
	Last turns swap blue with red or a blue/red space only gives lesser coins
	Survival Mode - if no coins and stars left, every round a heart will be taken. When player has no hearts left, he dies and gets to play as ghost,
	which has other aspects of the game (like fucking with other characters, stealing items, coins, special ability...) but can't win anymore
	Star costs more (~30?)

With advances or maximum difficulty Toads clothing changes to a dungeon masters'

	Tank fight (Battle game/Battle Royal) -> extra hard with "Captian Jack - In the army now"
